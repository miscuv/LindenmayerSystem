""" Welcome to the Lindenmayer System Program we created for our exam project!
    We chose this project because it looked interesting and seemed like a good
    way to combine some things we had learned in Math 1 this semester as well
    as what we learned in programming.
    
    Lindenmayer systems were created to model natural systems using simple and 
    iterable rules. This program will display a couple of these systems: Koch and
    Sierpinski.
    
    What this program does is it first asks you to select a Lindenmayer system.
    Then it will ask for a number of iterations. 
    NOTE! The number of iterations is limited to prevent excessive 
    computational runtime.
    Then the program will give you the option to plot the system. This will 
    display a plot with the selected Lindenmayer System
    
    Enjoy!
    
    -Veronica, Alex and Dylan

"""
This function takes the inputs of System(Koch or Sierpinski) and N(iterations)
and creates a string based on a series of rules which correspond to each system.
These rules are stored in a dicitonary.
